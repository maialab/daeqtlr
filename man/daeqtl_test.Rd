\usage{
daeqtl_test(
  ae_hom,
  ae_het,
  dae_threshold = log2(1.5),
  min_n_hom = 2L,
  min_n_het = 2L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ae_hom}{Numeric vector of AE ratios of the DAE SNP. Each element of the
vector refers to a sample that is homozygous (\code{hom}) for the candidate
SNP.}

\item{ae_het}{Numeric vector of AE ratios of the DAE SNP. Each element of the
vector refers to a sample that is heterozygous (\code{het}) for the
candidate SNP.}

\item{dae_threshold}{An allelic expression (AE) threshold (in log-scale). A
sample showing an absolute AE greater than \code{dae_threshold} is considered
"technically" \emph{differential allelic expressed}, meaning that the
imbalance observed is not below the limit of detection. Adjustment made to
this parameter should depend on the experimental assay sensitivity.}

\item{min_n_hom}{Minimum number of samples in the homozygous group to be
considered eligible for statistical testing.}

\item{min_n_het}{Minimum number of samples in the heterozygous group to be
considered eligible for statistical testing.}
}
\value{
A data frame of two columns:
\describe{
\item{pvalue}{The p-value associated with the statistical test, if performed; otherwise, \code{NA}.}
\item{case}{One of the four possible cases depicted in the figure above.
The identified case depends on the number of samples for each group and on
the pattern of the allelic expression (AE) ratios of the DAE SNP:
\describe{
\item{\code{1}}{\strong{Case 1}: the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
heterozygous and DAE SNP expression is available is below the minimum
eligibility criterion \code{min_n_het}.}
\item{\code{2}}{\strong{Case 2}: (i) the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
homozygous is below \code{min_n_hom}, and also, (ii) the values of the DAE
SNP AE ratios are not all either below or above the \code{dae_threshold}.}
\item{\code{3}}{\strong{Case 3}: the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
homozygous is below \code{min_n_hom}, however, the values of the DAE
SNP AE ratios are all either below or above the \code{dae_threshold}. This
case is followed by a one-sample Wilcox test whose null hypothesis is that
the AE ratios are zero.}
\item{\code{4}}{\strong{Case 4}: when both a minimum number of heterozygous and
homozygous samples for the candidate SNP are available, then a Wilcox test
is applied that compares the two groups. The AE ratios are first
transformed to absolute values. This is because we want to test departure
from zero in either direction. The null hypothesis is that absolute AE
ratios for the heterozygous group is less than or equal to the homozygous
group.}

\description{
This function implements daeqtlr's default approach for testing the
association between a candidate SNP zygosity and the allelic expression of a
DAE SNP. The method takes into account the pattern of the allelic expression
(AE) ratios' distribution displayed at each DAE SNP (depicted below), as this
is dependent on the linkage disequilibrium between the DAE SNP and the
candidate SNP. In some cases the requirements for application of this
methodology are not met and no measure of statistical association
significance is derived. These cases are depicted in the figure below, and
further explained in the section Value.

#
# Case 1
#
# The number of heterozygous samples (n = 1) does not meet the minimum
# required (default is `min_n_het` = 2). Hence, no statistical test is
# applied, the `pvalue` is `NA` and `case` is `1`.

#
# Case 2

# is clearly below that of the homozygous group, resulting in a
