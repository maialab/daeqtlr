\usage{
daeqtlr_mapping(
  ae_hom,
  ae_het,
  dae_threshold = log2(1.5),
  min_n_hom = 2L,
  min_n_het = 2L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ae_hom}{Numeric vector of AE ratios of the DAE SNP. Each element of the
vector refers to a sample that is homozygous (\code{hom}) for the candidate
SNP.}

\item{ae_het}{Numeric vector of AE ratios of the DAE SNP. Each element of the
vector refers to a sample that is heterozygous (\code{het}) for the
candidate SNP.}

\item{dae_threshold}{An allelic expression (AE) threshold (in log-scale). A
sample having showing an absolute AE greater than \code{dae_threshold} is
considered "technically" \emph{differential allelic expressed}, meaning
that the imbalance observed is not below the limit of detection. Adjustment
made to this parameter should depend on the experimental assay sensitivity.}

\item{min_n_hom}{Minimum number of samples in the homozygous group to be
considered elligible for statistical testing.}

\item{min_n_het}{Minimum number of samples in the heterozygous group to be
considered elligible for statistical testing.}
}
\value{
A data frame of two columns:
\describe{
\item{pvalue}{The p-value associated with the statistical test, if performed; otherwise, \code{NA}.}
\item{case}{One of the four possible cases depicted in the figure above.
The identified case depends on the number of samples for each group and on
the pattern of the allelic expression (AE) ratios of the DAE SNP:
\describe{
\item{\code{1}}{\strong{Case 1}: the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
heterozygous and DAE SNP expression is available is below the minimum
eligibility criterion \code{min_n_het}.}
\item{\code{2}}{\strong{Case 2}: (i) the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
homozygous is below \code{min_n_hom}, and also, (ii) the values of the DAE
SNP AE ratios are not all either below or above the \code{dae_threshold}.}
\item{\code{3}}{\strong{Case 3}: the number of samples for which the candidate SNP is
homozygous is below \code{min_n_hom}, however, the values of the DAE
SNP AE ratios are all either below or above the \code{dae_threshold}. This
case is followed by a one-sample Wilcox test whose null hypothesis is that
the AE ratios are zero.}
\item{\code{4}}{\strong{Case 4}: when both a minimum number of heterozygous and
homozygous samples for the candidate SNP are available, then a Wilcox test
is applied that compares the two groups. The AE ratios are first
transformed to absolute values. This is because we want to test departure
from zero in either direction. The null hypothesis is that absolute AE
ratios for the heterozygous group is less than or equal to the homozygous
group.}

\description{
This function implements daeqtlr's default mapping approach, i.e. the mapping
of SNPs associated with DAE. The mapping approach here implemented takes into
consideration the pattern of the allelic expression (AE) ratios' distribution
displayed at each DAE SNP (depicted below), as this is dependent on the
linkage disequilibrium between the DAE SNP and the candidate SNP.
