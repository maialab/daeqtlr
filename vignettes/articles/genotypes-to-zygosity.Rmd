```

Here is how to convert your genotypes to zygosity levels:

1. Read in the genotypes with `read_snp_genotypes()`.
2. Convert the returned data table by `read_snp_genotypes()` to zygosity levels
with `as_zygous()`.

```{r}
# Read in the genotypes
genotypes <- read_snp_genotypes(file = daeqtlr_example('genotypes.csv'))
genotypes[1:10, 1:16]

# Convert to zygosity levels
zygosity <- as_zygous(genotypes)

zygosity[1:10, 1:16]
```
