# daeqtlr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{daeqtlr}` is to perform differential allelic expression trait loci (DAEQTL) mapping.

Differential allelic expression (DAE) can be treated as a quantitative trait. Marker genotypes collected from the same set of individuals can, in turn, be used in testing statistical associations with DAE. This package provides routines for performing such a workflow, i.e. DAEQTL mapping.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{daeqtlr}` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maialab/daeqtlr")
```

## Usage

Coming soon. For the moment check out the documented functions at [maialab.org/daeqtlr](http://maialab.org/daeqtlr).
